## What is this?

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb64dc93-37e7-421f-bc5d-89a8ef43b7c8

This is a UserScript. The initial goal was to replicate the built-in word selection toolbar functionality found in modified browsers like Qihoo 360 Browser and Microsoft Edge, within native browsers like Chrome and Firefox. Since I didn't want to have to press the right mouse button or Ctrl+C shortcut every time I wanted to copy text, I used AI to write a simple script that allows for quick copying after selecting text. Later, as my ideas grew, I eventually pieced together this more feature-rich UserScript.

## How to install?

It is recommended to first install from [🔗**Greasy Fork**](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/558720), as the script on [🔗**Github Releases**](https://github.com/CodebyGPT/word_selection_toolbar/releases) does not support automatic updates.

If this is your first time installing a user script, you must first install a user script manager in your browser: For Chromium 138+ versions, we recommend using [🔗ScriptCat](https://docs.scriptcat.org/); for older Chromium and Firefox browsers, we recommend using [🔗Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [🔗ScriptCat (v0.16.x)](https://github.com/scriptscat/scriptcat/releases/tag/v0.16.11).

## Basic Features

* The user interface mimics the style of Apple Liquid Glass

* Support for multiple languages (via machine translation)

* Focus on low memory usage

* Event-driven, avoiding CPU-intensive code such as polling

* By default, no intrusive modifications are made to the webpage, and the script runs in a separate context to avoid polluting the webpage

* 100% offline operation (the script auto-update function is implemented by the script manager through regular reading of script metadata segments, and the script itself does not require internet connection)

* No obfuscated code, no commercial or malicious behavior
